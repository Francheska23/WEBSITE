        <h2>Hi, I'm Riley!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my world! You know, being a kid is a bit of a rollercoaster. One day, you’re full of Joy, and the next, Sadness sneaks in.
           I’ve learned that all these emotions—whether it's Anger, Disgust, Fear, or even Sadness—are a part of who I am, and they help me make
           sense of everything going on in my life.</p>
            <br>
        <p> By exploring different emotions in this website, you’ll see how I handle life’s ups and downs, and maybe even find new ways to understand your own feelings.
            Whether you’re happy, nervous, or even a little mad, there’s something here for everyone. 
            I hope you enjoy exploring this journey with me—just remember, it's okay to feel everything!</p>
            <br>
        <p>Whether I’m on the ice playing hockey, trying to make new friends, or just missing home, all my feelings play a part in helping me handle whatever comes my way. 
           It might seem confusing at first, but with each new challenge, I get a little better at understanding myself, and you will too.</p>
           <br>
        <p>So, go ahead—explore, play, and discover your emotions! I hope this site makes you feel welcome and reminds you that it’s okay to feel everything, 
           from joy to sadness, and everything in between. 
           After all, our emotions are what make us who we are!</p>
